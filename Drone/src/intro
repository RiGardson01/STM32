SPI Configuration – NRF24
  
I2C Configuration GY-80
  
USART Configuration HC-05
  
TIM2 Configuration For Motors
  

T = ((Prescaler + 1)* (ARR+1))/FCLK  (0.02s)
	PWM form 1ms to 2ms  => 2000<ARR<4000 

TIM4 for create a simple time to get Angle And caculate Out PWM to motor with F = ? Hz/s
 
 
F = FCLK/(ARR* (PSC+1))
ARR = 1000 => F = 100Hz/s
 

ADC 4 channel to read data from Sharp 2Y0A02
  
 
 
CXEMA PIN SELECT IN THIS PROJECT ON MICROCONTROLLER STM32F103C8T6
